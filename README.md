## 1. Introduction

**SiamSA** aims to provide a model-free solution for UAM tracking during approaching the object (for manipulation). Since the **Scale Variation** issue has been more crucial than general object-tracking scenes, the novel scale awareness is proposed with powerful attention methods.

Please refer to our project page, papers, dataset, and videos for more details.

## 2. UAMT100&UAMT20L benchmark

### 2.1 Introduction

- With 100 image sequences, **UAMT100** is a benchmark to evaluate object tracking methods for UAM approaching, while **UAMT20L** contains 20 long sequences. All sequences are recorded on a flying UAM platform;

- **16** kinds of **objects** are involved;

- **12 attributes** are annotated for each sequence:

  - aspect ratio change (ARC);background clutter (BC), fast motion (FM), low illumination (LI), object blur (OB), out-of-view (OV), partial occlusion (POC), similar object (SOB), scale variation (SV), **UAM attack (UAM-A)**, viewpoint change (VC), and **wind disturbance (WD)**.

### 2.2 Scale variation difference between UAV and UAM tracking 

<img src="/img/SV.png" width="540" alt="" />

*A larger area under the curve means a higher frequency of object SV. It is clear that SV of UAM tracking is much more common and severe than UAV tracking.*

### 2.3 Download and evaluation 

- Please download the dataset from our [project page](https://george-zhuang.github.io/siamsa/).
- You can directly download our evaluation results (.mat) of SOTA trackers on the UAMT benchmark from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18IUT9Yu7Oai62IE6AYSfWOy3XUEvzzqc/view?usp=sharing) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1OpXzu7FiXi3Mgn4i3K54Qw?pwd=v4rr).

## 3. Get started!

### 3.1 Environmental Setup

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04, Python 3.8.3, Pytorch 1.6.0, CUDA 10.2.
Please install related libraries before running this code: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vision4robotics/SiamSA
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3.2 Test

- For testing SiamSA_IROS22:
  - Download SiamSA_IROS22 model from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CeSwuycTE5LpwUpK4iQVSC8MuxvGiQB-/view?usp=sharing) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LWtPQYYQoN7_5P9wkCr23w?pwd=v4rb) and put it into `snapshot` directory.
- For testing SiamSA_TII22:
  - Download SiamSA_TII22 model from [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wVfyp4hUB415hb1d06fea3y2DDHhPD6G/view?usp=sharing) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1FX-6BpvFINUpVOFGUal0Dg?pwd=v4re) and put it into `snapshot` directory.
- Download testing datasets (UAMT100/UAMT20L/UAV123@10fps) and put them into `test_dataset` directory. If you want to test the tracker on a new dataset, please refer to [pysot-toolkit](https://github.com/StrangerZhang/pysot-toolkit) to set test_dataset.


```
python tools/test.py 	                    \
	--trackername SiamSA                   \ # tracker_name
	--dataset UAMT100                       \ # dataset_name
	--snapshot snapshot/model.pth             # model_path
```

The testing result will be saved in the `results/dataset_name/tracker_name` directory.

### 3.3 Evaluate 

If you want to evaluate the tracker mentioned above, please put those results into `results` directory.

```
python eval.py 	                      \
	--tracker_path ./results          \ # result path
	--dataset UAMT100                 \ # dataset_name
	--tracker_prefix 'model'            # tracker_name
```
